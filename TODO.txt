Sound:
    Fade BGM when in a menu
    Random cries in the overworld
    Fanfares
    Surf music logic
    Encounter music logic (and battle script commands without encounter music)
    Victory music logic
    Saving music to load next time

Nice to have (no priority):
    Changable tiles based on day/night
    Reflections on tiles
    Different day tints based on season
    Obj Following (#29)
    Attack animations with camera movement
    Pass Powers

Sounds cool but definitely not necessary at all:
    Color lookup tables for day tints
    Move/Item effect/data integration with battle engine (not needed because you can just clone and edit the battle engine to add these things and more, like new species/forms)
    Chatot special cry (if this is done, add it as a field move)
