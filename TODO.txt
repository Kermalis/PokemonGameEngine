Encounters:

    StickyHold, SuctionCups
    Phenomena (task system)
    Fishing
    Determine battle music

Field Effects:
    Spin tiles
    Bike
    Ledges
    Blocks that start scripts (bookshelves, tvs, PC, etc)
    Countertops that forward the script (mart employees)
    Repels
    Field moves:
        Cut
        Fly (requires world map and heal locations)
        Strength
        Flash
        Dig

        Soft-Boiled
        Waterfall
        Rock Smash
        Headbutt
        Sweet Scent
        Milk Drink
        Dive

Data Stuff:
    Item pouches
    Dump TMHM compatibility
    Wild Pkmn with items

Sound:
    Fade BGM when in a menu
    Random cries in the overworld (task system)
    Fanfares
    Surf music logic
    Encounter music logic (and battle script commands without encounter music)
    Saving music to load next time

Nice to have (no priority):
    Changable tiles based on day/night
    Reflections on tiles
    Different day tints based on season
    Obj Following (#29)
    Attack animations
    Pass Powers
    Move relearner & Move tutor
    Feebas/Swarm/Roamer
    Mail
    Ribbons
    Weather visuals

Sounds cool but definitely not necessary at all:
    Color lookup tables for day tints
    Move/Item effect/data integration with battle engine (not needed because you can just clone and edit the battle engine to add these things and more, like new species/forms)
    Battle sprite & trainer sprite shadows with rotation (like gen 5)
    Chatot special cry (if this is done, add it as a field move)
