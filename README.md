Pokémon Game Engine is a C# game engine that is similar to the 2D Pokémon games.
It uses [PokemonBattleEngine](https://github.com/Kermalis/PokemonBattleEngine) for the battles.
It can run on any platform, even phones! (With some work... contact me)

Here are some preview images & videos, but keep in mind the quality lost when recording:

This project is still in an early stage so don't expect to make a full game with it at this time, although you can start using it.
[Check the wiki](https://github.com/Kermalis/PokemonGameEngine/wiki) if you're interested (I put a lot of effort into writing it!).
